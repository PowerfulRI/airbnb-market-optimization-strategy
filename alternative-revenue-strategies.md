   - Sarasota: Florida sunshine, pool weather year-round
   - Both markets have active creative/professional communities

### WEAKNESSES

1. **Operational Complexity**
   - Managing multiple platforms increases administrative burden
   - Different booking systems to monitor
   - Varying cancellation policies to track

2. **Scheduling Conflicts**
   - Must carefully manage calendar to avoid overlap with Airbnb bookings
   - Short-notice Airbnb bookings could conflict with scheduled events
   - Requires active calendar management

3. **Wear and Tear Concerns**
   - Events may cause more damage than overnight guests
   - Higher turnover = more cleaning
   - Photo equipment, event setups could damage property

4. **Limited Track Record**
   - No reviews on alternative platforms yet
   - New listings take time to gain traction
   - Must build reputation from scratch

5. **Insurance Gaps**
   - Standard Airbnb coverage may not apply
   - Event liability requires additional coverage
   - Pool rentals have inherent liability risks

### OPPORTUNITIES

## Performance Insights from Airbnb Dashboard

### Hartford Portfolio Performance (All Units)

**Occupancy Trends:**
| Month | Occupancy | Pattern |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| August 2025 | 73.9% | High season |
| September 2025 | **87.0%** | Peak performance |
| October 2025 | 66.7% | Shoulder season |
| November 2025 | **14.3%** | Winter drop begins |
| December 2025 | 0.0% | Low season |
| January 2026 | 6.5% | Low season |
| February 2026 | 3.6% | Low season |

**Critical Finding:** 85% occupancy decline from September (87%) to November (14.3%)

**Conversion Metrics (Unit 1 - 2BR Sample):**
| Metric | Peak (Oct) | Current (Jan) |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| First-page search impression | 53.8% | 48.6% |
| Search-to-listing click | 15.55% | 13.63% |
| Listing-to-booking | 6.93% | 1.74% |
| Overall conversion | 1.08% | 0.24% |

> *Note: Overall conversion is sourced directly from Airbnb's host dashboard analytics. These are the actual end-to-end conversion rates as calculated by Airbnb, which may factor in additional variables beyond the simple funnel multiplication.*

**Key Insight:** Listings maintain search visibility (46-54% first-page impressions) but booking conversion drops dramatically in winter. The 4x drop in listing-to-booking conversion (6.93% → 1.74%) suggests **pricing strategy** is the primary issue, not listing quality.

### Sarasota Performance

**Current Status:** 0% occupancy for Dec-Jan period
**Concern:** This is Sarasota's PEAK season - immediate action needed

## LISTING 4: Unit 1 - Zen Manor 2BR

### Current Title
`Walk to Trinity! Hartford 2BR Gem Barry Square`

### Recommended SEO-Optimized Titles (50 char limit)
1. **`Hartford 2BR | Indoor Hammock | Near Trinity`** (Primary - unique feature)
2. **`Boho Hartford 2BR | Walk to Hospital | Parking`** (Medical traveler focus)
3. **`Artsy Hartford 2BR | Trinity Area | Sleeps 5`** (Capacity focus)
4. **`Hartford Gem 2BR | Garden View | Free Parking`** (Amenity focus)

### Title Analysis
- Current title is decent but "Gem" is vague
- "Barry Square" is not a widely searched term
- Missing key differentiator (indoor hammock is unique!)
- "Walk to Trinity" is good but could specify Hospital vs College
